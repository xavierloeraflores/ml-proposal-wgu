## COMPETENCIES
4036.1.11 : Machine Learning
The graduate creates models with machine learning algorithms in order to extract actionable insights from data.

## INTRODUCTION
Machine learning is the “science and art of programming computers so they can learn from data” (Géron, 2019, p. 1). Machine learning is a collection of approaches that automates analytical model building and supports the discovery of insights from data. This assumes that algorithms can learn and improve from data, including examples, direct experience, or instruction; identify relationships; and help make decisions with minimal interventions from the human user. It is the pivotal engine behind artificial intelligence efforts supporting supervised, unsupervised, and reinforced learning algorithms enabling the analysis of massive amounts of data.

While early forms of machine learning have existed for decades, in recent years the applications of machine learning fueled by vast new amounts of “big data” have grown exponentially. Advertisement placements, dating recommendations, genetic medicines, baseball, stock market investing, and self-driving cars are just a few domains that are heavily driven by machine learning technologies. Ethical issues are emerging from these developments that still have not been fully resolved by society. But one thing appears certain: machine learning is here to stay.

In this course you have read about many of the foundational concepts and techniques of machine learning. This task asks you create a detailed proposal concerning how machine learning techniques could be applied to a relevant data set of your choosing, what possible outcomes might be expected, and why such outcomes could be organizationally significant.
SCENARIO
In this assignment, you will assume the role of a recently hired machine learning engineer in an organization that has been asked to use available data to identify an organizational need that could be solved by machine learning. The organization then needs to outline a plan for designing and executing a machine learning model to solve this organizational need. You will explore available data sets and machine learning algorithms supporting the construction of a model that the organization would use, following the plan that you put together. You will outline the problem, the solution, and the project plan, as well as the framework for evaluating the success of the model and the project.

## REQUIREMENTS

3.  Explain how you will apply a standard methodology (e.g., CRISP-DM, SEMMA) to the implementation of your proposed project.
4.  Provide a projected timeline for the proposed project, including the start and end dates for each task.
5.  List resources (e.g., hardware, software, work hours, third-party services) and all associated costs needed to implement the proposed solution.
6.  Describe the criteria that you will use to evaluate the success of the project once it is completed.

### C. Machine Learning Solution Design
C.  Describe the proposed machine learning solution you will use to address the organizational need identified in part A1 by doing the following:

a.  Justify the selection of the algorithm in part C2. Include one advantage and one limitation of the selected machine learning method.
3.  Describe the tools and environments that will be used to develop the proposed machine learning solution, including any third-party code.
4.  Explain the process you will use to measure the performance of your proposed machine learning solution.

### D. Description of Data Set(s)
D.  Describe the data for your proposed project by doing the following:
1.  Identify the source(s) of the data for your proposed project.
2.  Describe the data collection method.
a.  Discuss one advantage and one limitation of the data collection method described in part D2.
3.  Explain how you will prepare your data for use by the machine learning algorithm(s) from part C2 for your proposed project, including data set formatting, missing data, outliers, dirty data, or mitigation of other data anomalies.
4.  Describe behaviors that should be exercised when working with and communicating about sensitive data in your project.
