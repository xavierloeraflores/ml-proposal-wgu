# Machine Learning Project Proposal

## Project Overview
The following project proposal will demonstrate the need for a machine learning solution that implements image recognition to address an organizational need. The proposal will include a project overview, project design, machine learning solution design, and a description of the data sets that will be used to train the machine learning model.

### Organizational Need

A social media company needs a machine learning solution to automatically detect what type of content is in an image to flag the post as explicit or not explicit for moderation and content filtering purposes. The platform needs to be able to automatically detect the content of images as the user uploads the images to the platform. 

### Context and Background
The company has seen a significant increase in the number of images with explicit content being uploaded to their platform. While the platform allows users to manually mark their posts as NSFW or explicit, many users are not doing so, and the company receives numerous complaints from users who do not wish to see explicit content. This will allow the moderation team to focus on images with explicit content and remove them from the platform. It would also allow the company to blur or hide explicit images from users who do not wish to see them.
